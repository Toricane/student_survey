            <p>This map visualizes student responses regarding how to improve comfort in reporting incidents. Each point represents a response, and responses closer together are semantically similar. Points are colored by cluster.</p>

                <li>The survey responses for each question are processed using an algorithm to group the responses based on how they semantically relate to one another.</li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Anonymity and Confidentiality:</strong>
                        Students overwhelmingly desire anonymous reporting mechanisms to protect themselves from retaliation. This includes online reporting, QR codes, and ensuring the reporter's identity remains undisclosed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Accountability and Consequences:</strong>
                        There's a strong desire for consequences for perpetrators and assurance that reports will be taken seriously and acted upon. This includes a call for stricter disciplinary measures for serious offenses.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Improved Communication and Support:</strong>
                        Students want increased communication about reporting procedures and a more supportive, less judgmental environment for reporting incidents. This includes designated personnel and improved teacher training on how to handle reports sensitively.

                <p>Lack of knowledge/experience and a desire for increased support/safety.

                        <strong>Enhanced School Safety and Security:</strong>
                        This theme encompasses increased staff presence (more teachers, security, police officers), stricter discipline for misbehavior (punishments, expulsions), and improved monitoring of students (especially during lunch and breaks).
