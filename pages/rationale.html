                    <strong>Main Themes Identified:</strong>
                    Lack of significant change and mixed experiences. The responses reflect a perception of minimal alteration to the existing situation, with some expressing negative sentiments (more boring, harder) while others indicate a neutral or slightly positive perspective (more freedom).

                <p>
                    <strong>Main Themes Identified:</strong>
                    Increased academic rigor and workload, coupled with decreased social support and extracurricular activities, mark the transition from elementary to high school. The shift is characterized by a greater emphasis on grades and a perceived loss of the more relaxed and supportive environment of elementary school.

                <p>
                    <strong>Main Themes Identified:</strong>
                    Irrelevance due to prior absence and lack of engagement. Students were not present during the relevant timeframe, resulting in their inability or unwillingness to provide meaningful responses. A secondary theme is general disengagement or negative feelings towards school.
