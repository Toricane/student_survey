                        Students overwhelmingly express feeling included and connected, suggesting the staff are already doing well in this area. Requests for improved socialization opportunities are framed within this existing positive sentiment.

                    The core message of Cluster 4 centers around
                    <strong>fostering a stronger sense of community and belonging</strong>
                    . This is achieved through increased opportunities for social interaction (more school-wide and inter-grade activities, open classrooms, group work) and improved teacher-student relationships (greater friendliness, personalized attention, trust, and understanding). A secondary theme involves
                    <strong>improving student engagement and well-being</strong>
                    , suggested through schedule adjustments (shorter classes, longer breaks) and a focus on inclusive activities that cater to diverse interests.
